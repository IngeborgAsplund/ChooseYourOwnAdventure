#Merfolk Encounter
Curious about the humanoind shapes %%Name%% approaches them but as soon as they comes closer the shapes
dives beneath the surface and dissapear, leaving nothing but ripples on the surface in of the pristine lagoon.
As %%Name%% look down into the clear blue grean water a face emerges from underneath. Green in color, fishlike
with fins grwoing from she cheekbones and the forhead, eyes rounded big, dark red and pupilless.
The creature launches up from beneath revealing a vaugley humanlike torso covered in scales attached to a long slivering snakelike
tail ending in a wide fin. It opens it mouth which are wider than it should be reavealing rows and rows of sharp teeth
within.
&Jungle:Run!
&Death2:Try and Communicate
===
#Death2
Against better judgement %%Name%% tries to communicate with the creature despite it dicplaying a clearly agressive behaviour.
The mermaid lashes out snapping with its teeth, giving out what sounds like a mix between a hiss and a screach. Sharp teeth
sink into the flesh of %%Name%% and a feeling of neverending darkness comes over them. All of a sudden %%Name%% cannot breath
the air around them, and an emminent dryness comes across their skin. Looking down at the bitten arm %%Name%% can see how
bluish green scales thirsty for water rapidly spreads from the bite. And in the water below they see how the color of their
eyes shifts in color to a red.
